This is a simple static content project with very mimimal glue to piece
some existing tools together. I think that it's quite a nice way to manage
it, but obviously most of you will have different preferences. If you are
a software developer then you'll likely be able to make sense of the
Makefile to start at least. Contributions are welcome to either the
project architecture and tooling, the truth (i.e., the bindings), or the
content/ideas themselves.

Signatures are also welcome. Signatures are meant to represent your
affirmation that you support the project and agree with the truths in it.
I recommend identifying the version of the file(s) that you are signing
since it is composed from living documents and untruths (or untruths in
your world view) can be introduced at any time. If the document is buggy
(i.e., you don't agree with it) then your contributions can be suggestions
to make it less buggy.
