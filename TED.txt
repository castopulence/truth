I'm about to rewrite every story you've ever written. AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU LIKE IT OR NOT!

I need everybody to hold onto their seat. Take a moment to scan the room around you so that you get a good SENSE of where you are and what's going on in your world right now. I'm about to tell the truth. The cold, hard truth. A wise man told us that the truth will set you free. Well he was right, but what he didn't know at the time was how, and nobody has been able to figure it out since. Well I have it all figured out. So perk up, focus intently. You won't want to miss this.
I guess I should start where most of these do. With some backstory on who I am so that you can better understand my qualifications.

Hello. My name is Brandon Andrew McCaig. I'm a 35 year old male homo sapien sapien deriving my genes most recently from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, but also from the recent past of the United Kingdom and France. My skin colour is called white, just like most of the other people that are most like me.

YOU'RE ALL ANIMALS!

Sorry. I hope I didn't startle anyone. I'm just trying to make sure that you can hear me.
