THE TRUTH - but only as far as we see it (so far)

Published at https://castopulence.org and
https://castopulence.org/TRUTH.html.

The hive mind repo is starting at https://github.com/castopulence/truth/.
See also any forks you can find. They all have bugs, but we might as well
merge and fix what we can.

There is much work to do. We will need to improve the tools before they're
ready for prime-time. We also need to continue working on the truth
itself. It's going to start out slow because we are imprisoned to the
social orders that have existed for countless generations to try to keep
us alive. And they're composed of us, and we're afraid and skeptical, so
it will take some time before we manage to convince ourselves that we can
do better than justifying our existence with jobs that support a family
even if the work that we're doing is actually harmful for the collective.
