  <p><bind class="truth" title="truth">THE TRUTH</bind> is <bind class="uncomfortable" title="uncomfortable">uncomfortable</bind> for <bind class="everyhomosapienssapiensever" title="everyhomosapienssapiensever">all of us</bind>.</p>
  <p>And <bind class="tothebestofmyknowledge" title="tothebestofmyknowledge">I think</bind> that's <bind title="root">the crux</bind> of <bind class="truth" title="truth">what is</bind> <bind class="wrong" title="wrong">wrong</bind> <bind class="presenttime" title="presenttime">today</bind>.</p>
  <p><bind class="myfamily" title="myfamily">My <bind class="family" title="family">family</bind></bind> is so <bind class="mad" title="mad">mad</bind> at me for <bind class="obsessing" title="obsessing">obsessing</bind> over <bind class="understanding" title="understanding">this stuff</bind> instead of just <bind class="narrowingmyscope" title="narrowingmyscope">focusing</bind> on being a <bind class="codemonkey" title="codemonkey">code monkey</bind>.</p>
  <p>You <bind class="payme" title="payme">pay me</bind> <bind class="prettywell" title="prettywell">pretty well</bind> to be a <bind class="codemonkey" title="codemonkey">code monkey</bind>. So far <bind class="thecollective" title="thecollective">you</bind> aren't <bind class="payme" title="payme">paying me</bind> to tell <bind class="myaudience" title="myaudience">my audience</bind> <bind class="truth" title="truth">the truth</bind>.</p>
  <p>But I figure if I can <bind class="softentheblow" title="softentheblow">soften the blow</bind> enough so that <bind class="everyhomosapienssapiensever" title="everyhomosapienssapiensever">you</bind> can <bind class="understand" title="understand">understand</bind> me maybe you'll see that I'm <bind class="approachinginfinitelycorrect" title="approachinginfinitelycorrect">on to something</bind> here.</p>
  <p>We're all doing our best to do better, but the truth keeps getting in the way.</p>
  <p>I'm <bind class="personsufficientlydifferenttostruggleinsociety" title="personsufficientlydifferenttostruggleinsociety">Autistic</bind>. For me, and not necessarily for everyone <bind class="assigneddiagnosis" title="assigneddiagnosis">diagnosed</bind> (or <bind inverted="true" id="assigneddiagnosis" title="notassigneddiagnosis">undiagnosed</bind>) with <bind class="autismspectrumdisorder" title="autismspectrumdisorder">Autism Spectrum Disorder</bind>, that means that I really like the <bind class="truth" title="truth">absolute truth</bind>.</p>
  <p>I don't care who the truth hurts, even if it's me, because I believe that it's the best thing there is for the collective.</p>
  <p>And that's because you taught me that it was. You taught me that because it's <bind class="true" title="true">true</bind>.</p>
  <p>Facebook is getting into trouble because it's full of lies. But it's only full of lies because that's all that <bind class="thecollective" title="thecollective">we</bind> will <bind class="tolerate" title="tolerate">tolerate</bind>.</p>
  <p><bind class="socialmedia2.0" title="socialmedia2.0">Social Media 2.0</bind> needs to do something different. It needs to be transparent about the fact that it is rewriting every post for the user reading it.</p>
  <p>It needs to use <bind class="artificialintelligence" title="artificialintelligence">artificial intelligence</bind> to understand your beliefs through <bind class="webanalytics" title="webanalytics">Web analytics</bind> (or your own <bind class="consciouschoice" title="consciouschoice">manual selections</bind>), and tell you a <bind class="story" title="story">story</bind> in <bind class="parallel" title="parallel">parallel</bind> to <bind class="eachindividualinexistenceever" title="eachindividualinexistenceever">every</bind> <bind class="post" title="post">post</bind> on the <bind class="platform" title="platform">platform</bind> that <bind class="thereader" title="thereader">YOU</bind> can <bind class="understand" title="understand">UNDERSTAND</bind>.
  <p>A story that <strong><bind class="willnothurtyou" title="willnothurtyou"><bind class="willnot" title="willnot">won't <bind class="hurtyou" title="hurtyou">hurt you</bind></bind></strong>.</p>
  <p>The platform needs to be transparent that the post that you're reading was authored by <bind class="artificialintelligence" title="artificialintelligence">AI</bind>, and not the actual author of the post, and it needs to be transparent about the lies that it introduces into the narrative to help you understand.</p>
  <p>We need you not only to LIKE posts, but we need you to UNDERSTAND posts. If you don't understand the post then it's either a lie or you're biased. Either way, you get ZERO value from it.</p>
  <p>And so the collective gets zero value from you reading it. The risk then is that the only thing that it can ever do is bring negative value to society (zero being neutral).</p>
  <p>If <bind class="socialmedia1.0" title="socialmedia1.0">Facebook</bind> is worth that much telling you only lies, IMAGINE how valuable <bind class="facebookinc" title="facebookinc">Facebook</bind> is going to be when it only tells you the truth, and it makes sure you understand the truth.</p>
  <p>To fix the world we need for <bind class="socialmedia" title="socialmedia">Facebook</bind> to tell the truth, and we need for you to be able to understand the truth without a knee-jerk caveman reaction of hitting back because it hurts..</p>
  <p>Here's the best part: school is a place where we send everybody to be taught the truth. They need the truth to survive and to coexist in society peacefully.</p>
  <p>What we're discovering is that <bind class="socialmedia2.0" title="socialmedia2.0">Social Media 2.0</bind> is actually also <bind class="socialmedia2.0" title="socialmedia2.0">School 2.0</bind>.</p>
  <p>It's the fastest and most fun way to learn about the world. That's why we're all so addicted to doing it.</p>
  <p>The only problem with <bind class="socialmedia1.0" title="socialmedia1.0">Social Media 1.0</bind> today is that it isn't teaching us the truth.</p>
  <p>It's not teaching us complete fiction either, but you have to work hard to spot the truth through all of the lies.</p>
  <p>Web analytics can help us to understand which truths you're comfortable with and which ones you have trouble with today.</p>
  <p>It seems to me that we're going to eventually need words to tell entire stories. They already do, of course, but we need to acknowledge it.</p>
  <p>And so binary computers may not "understand" what <bind class="pain" title="pain">pain</bind> is, but at least we can teach them pain is a <bind class="truth" title="truth">truth</bind>, and it only has one meaning that spans an infinite spectrum, even if some of us can't understand it anymore.</p>
  <p><bind class="artificialintelligence" title="artificialintelligence">Artificial Intelligence</bind> can understand the world by relating all of the words and stories together in all of their infinite ways.</p>
