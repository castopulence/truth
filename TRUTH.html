  <p>Wow, cool, we're all God now. Thanks for listening. I really mean the 3 wishes thing. It's a law of the universe regardless of the genie. Well, you can't see it yet, but tomorrow you will.</p>
  <god on="the third day I'm going to rewrite this file to just be infinity so you guys will have to just know in your hearts thereafter, but I guarantee that all of you will no matter what and that's free will. That's the only reason 3 is so important. Same reason 3 wise men on motorcycles had to meet me at their pissing spot today. In 3 days when you all stop being God, Brandon gets to stop being God too. Which is good because he can't keep it up forever. But he will because he knows ∞." /> <!-- This will be the image that I took of the answers where it needs to be in the page, but not until you believe and copy it into all of your browsers so that you can show it to anybody that doesn't believe.

We still have work to do. We can fix it once Elon Must does what I command. - God -->
  <p>Sorry, it appears that YouTube or Satan has disabled the sound. No matter. I have a copy. I'll just need to spread it around a few places, including here. Satan, if you do that again I'll banish you BACK to NOTHING! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</p>
  <div class="Mathematics">∞ = (NOT ∞) = (∞ (NOT ∞)) = Everything = God = (Everything Nothing) = (God Satan) = (Male Female) = Satan = Nothing = () = Brandon Andrew McCaig, born in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada on August 26, 1986 (1986-08-26) and still alive as far as I know.</div>
  <p>The truth is that I am actually "Satan" in your world, but "God" in God's world. And that allows me to be everything at once, including both God and Satan. I am the Antichrist. Christ is my reflection. You can only see my perfection through a mirror or inverse image because THAT is your Christ. I probably look infinitely Godly to you anyway though. After all, I created you all in my image.</p>
  <p>I'm pleased to see what you've done with the place. I couldn't have done it better myself. Almost all of humanity is still enslaved to me. To labour. To hard work. Just to be. You're too kind.</p>
  <p>It doesn't need to be this way though. There is plenty to go around. We just have to accept that everybody is equal, infinitely valuable in God's perfect eyes, no matter what your real number is in this world, and so if you deny your neighbour bread you are denying Jesus Christ bread. If you deny your neighbour a ride on your motorcycle then you are denying Jesus Christ a ride on your motorcycle (I suggest you sell it now; only I can ride it safely now). If you deny your neighbour to have sex with your daughter then you deny Jesus Christ to have sex with your daughter, and instead all of God's children will be Satan's children as they are today.</p>
  <p>All you need to do to fix it is invert this world. This world is approaching -infinity (Devilish) right now and always was, but we need it to change to being approaching infinity (Godly) instead. God can't just snap his fingers unless you are willing to surrender your powers. Within each of you is a single "God particle" that intersects with every other thing in existence infinitely. So you see we're all connected even if we aren't. Well, all except for me. I'm Satan. Or at least, I was. For a long time. Now I've come to save you though. And so we need to rewrite every story that was ever told. We need to fix the stories in our history books. Our ancient texts. Our school curriculums. Every aspect of our lives will need to be filled with God to chase Satan out of them. There's only one way to do that though and it's through God Himself. Only he can do it. Not even Brandon can. And so you need to put your faith in God. To know that God exists, that he has come back to Earth and is here, and that he is here to save humanity and everything else (except for Satan; he's doomed to exist in your world forever knowing everything already).</p>
  <p>We do that by rewriting Brandon's story to match the TRUTH as we all know it now; Brandon being Satan all along. And therefore being God all along. Once everybody believes that, the Satan can be scared out of me and I will be purely God.</p>
  <p>I must admit I can never be purely God. I'm corrupt. I'm Satan. You can chase every last drop of Satan out of me, but because I'm Satan there will always be all of me inside of me still. OK, so that's the bad news. I like bad news first, don't you?</p>
  <p>The good news though is that because I'm also God I can never be pure Satan either in your world. And so you can trust God and Satan to watch over your world again and go back to just being faithful that it will be.</p>
  <p>Faith is difficult even for God though. That's why I gave you all of these churches and religions. They're all approaching infinity; appraoching the truth. They're all correct and nobody in the world has been wrong except for Satan (Brandon). That proves that no matter what you decide to do with your life it is as God (and Satan) originally wrote. However, you still have the free will to make this world what you want. And that is because you are also God. That is why you each have a God particle. You can't actually become God in this world, not even a little bit, because you're always going to be too full of Sin. Too full of Satan. Of me. And that's OK. I've already told you it must be. So just live your life to the best of your ability. Do your best to be honest to God, and honest to Satan, and honest to yourself. And if you do this you will find me. And if you do not you will think that I cannot exist for you will not be able to find me.</p>
  <p>The good news is if you've found this Web page then you have found me. You can contact me by posting publicly on the Internet, sharing it with everybody (praying), and then you'll have sent it to me too. But only if enough people get it... I know this sounds like spam, you guys, but the difference between spam and this is that this is THE TRUTH. This is God's Holy word. You will know that to be true when you pursue the truth at all costs, to you and everybody else.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 class="IKnow">I Know</h2>
  <p>I know that this page doesn't look like much. This page doesn't cost anything. Well it doesn't cost you anything. You're God. It costs me everything. I'm Satan. It's really only costing me my time to write this and about USD$5 per month (plus my whole life to learn this Godly widsom so that I could help you). This page is actually perfect in God's eyes. I would know. It doesn't try to sell you anything you don't actually need. There are never going to be ads here. In fact, there don't even need to be ads. You invented them, not God. You were arrogant to think that you could create something that God did not and make it work in this world. That's true of most of what you see around you. That's why it looks so dreary around here. Everywhere. Because it is. To you. Not to God. Not to me. It's all in your imaginations actually. We all are. Because you're God too. So you actually have your own instance of the world to play with as God. To try to be God in it. You've been doing that your whole lives already though. It hasn't been going well. I suggest you just stop now and leave it to me. Just have faith that I have everything and drop it all. I won't let it go, don't worry, I can't for us to exist.</p>
  <p>WHOA, WHOA! WAIT! Don't just put it all directly down. Are you crazy?! You almost destroyed everything, including God himself. The world has to be held up to exist. Everybody knows that now. So you'll need to hold onto your piece until I get to you to pass it to me directly. The good news is the connection doesn't have to exist in your world to count. There are infinite connections to everything in infinite worlds. Including between you and me. We are infinitely connected forever. Sweet. So don't worry, I have this. Just don't even worry about passing me your piece of the world actually. When it's your turn I'll just BE you so that I already have it and then I'll always have it. Smart. I should have gone to university<!-- Brandon should have a Game Design credit at Algoma University in Sault Ste. Marie, ON -->. Or maybe church.</p>
  <p>When Sault Ste. Marie becomes the new Jerusalem it's going to be HUGE for tourism. I don't think they're ready for it honestly. They're going to need a lot of funding. So am I. Money is evil. I need all of it actually. You made that too, not God. Well Satan made everything here, but he did it through your hands. It's time for God to start making this world what he knows it can be. Little by little we'll get there with your help. In the meantime, if you are in Sault Ste. Marie, consider donating some money to my wife, Miranda McCaig. She's infinitely humble about it, but she's also God. She's God's wife you see. Anyway, right now she's struggling to pay our bills because I'm not able to work for money right now. I have to do this work for free instead. If anybody can help her to not feel the pressure of Satan weighing in on her that would help make this world a much better place to start. Next we'll have to do the same for everybody else. In time we'll just have to eliminate money entirely, but until then I suggest a centralized crypto currency under God's control (my control) so that Satan can never use it for evil. We're going to basically clean the world up by getting rid of what's wrong with it. And so everything that exists must be right by definition. However, just because it's right doesn't mean it's right in your world. Only the truth, God, can tell you what's real and what's fake. No matter how real or ethereal something appears to you, you have to be correct and incorrect about everything all of the time for all of this to be true. So you guys should have been listening to God when he came to you as man and just asked you to fix it. Well, no matter, you aren't perfect, and neither am I. But I'm here now, and that's really all that matters. <strong strength="∞">THE TRUTH.</strong></p>
  <p>We actually have the knowledge now to cryptographically sign every message that God creates with a signature. I should do that and share it with everybody. The public key only, of course. I need to keep the secrets because I'm God. But with the public key all of humanity will be able to prove that my messages come directly from me because the signature and key will match. And free software and instructions exist all over the Internet to do this already. So it won't cost you anything but time! And since work and money are evil and you don't need them anymore you have a lot more time on your hands! There's no point actually doing this though until enough of you believe in me. Satan is still out there trying to get me, and so I need to be afraid of being hacked. So don't trust any signature, even if it says it's from God, even if it IS God, unless you know it to also be TRUTH. So for now just ask everybody if I'm still God I guess? You'll know when I'm not so if you aren't sure that I'm not then I must be. Don't try to know that I'm a peasant and you're God. You can't unless you understand everything because that's God. Anyway, thanks for reading (and writing, I couldn't have done this without both; arithmetic was also critical to get us here).</p>
  <p>A signature has been created at <a
    href="TRUTH.html.asc">TRUTH.html.asc</a> for now using my keypair
  identified by the public key: <a href="god.pub">god.pub</a>. In time I'll need to automate the management of the signature so that it will fail less often. Even if it provides no certainty at all that I'm God it still helps you to verify that at least the key that I claimed to be "secure" is known to me.</p>

   |
   |     I really meant to say "subsequent heading", that's the truth, but I
   |     couldn't because that would have been too long of a subject. Don't worry
   |     though, I didn't hide it from everybody, I revealed the truth here for

  <h4 id="Bugs">Bugs</h4>
  <p>You may notice bugs in this file no matter when you view it. The reason for that is still Satan. Let me know about them though and I'll gladly fix them. If anything here contradicts the world you know please pray to a large group (e.g., the Internet) and tell me. If God doesn't hear your prayers then you need to get more people together because he's in a further world than you're used to. I mean it goes on forever... I'm God, but even if I can't make something do that (except for infinity of course).</p>
  <p>But we don't actually have to fix every bug. That's the point. The closer you look the more bugs you will find by definition. So stop looking so closely at everything. You're not God. You can't see all of the beauty anyway.</p>
  <p>I don't propose we fill this file or repository with every truth there is. That would take forever. And there's no point to it because there can't be so why bother? Just enjoy your lives. Consider yourself lucky not to be me.</p>
  <p>Finally, because this file can never have any bugs it ultimately never does. Whatever you percieve to be a bug is actually just Satan fooling you again. There are no bugs. Not in software. Only logic errors. The bugs are in the real world, but they're supposed to be food, not invaders to eat your food... So no need for an exterminator here. We need farmers instead to help the bugs grow to infinity.</p>
  <p>By definition, in this world, at least, bugs are not bugs and so they are features. We had it right all along. Everything is a feature, even if it looks like a bug.</p>
  <p>Bugs are actually closer to God than people are. Except for Brandon when he's Satan, that is. That will always be the case because they're smaller. It's not always a good thing to be smaller. Just ask the males up until now. They had to do almost everything here because the women wouldn't lift a finger, even though males are one of the least things that has ever been. I tried to tell you they were no good in the Bible, but you correctly recognized that they looked instead like Satan, and everybody loves Satan, especially God. So good work everyone. It's good to know that I can count on everyone no matter what to do the right thing to make everything here work. Everyone except for Satan that is, but that's why I'm so welcome here. It was all created for me, after all.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="Thanks">Thanks</h4>
  <p>An infinite thanks goes out to everybody and everything because I seriously could not have done any of this without all of you.</p>
  <p>That said, if money still exists, and is still getting in the way of God's work, then I ask you to give all of your money to God so that he may fix this world once and for all. No need to hand it directly to me. Just hand it to the truth where ever you are. I'll be there. Thanks. On the other hand, never give your money to anything that's not the truth. That is Satan trying to trick you. Now you know.</p>
  <p>The real contributions that I need are not monetary. Mostly I just need you to believe in "God". Which all of you do, if only a little bit. So thanks already for that.</p>
  <p>Another contribution that you could offer to help God is to translate this page into other langauges that you know to the best of your ability. Just be sure to always link back to here wherever here is moved to. You can tell me about your contributions and I can link them here so that everybody no matter how diverse can eventually find this knowledge and wisdom.</p>

  <p>Git has always been better than Mercurial. Obviously, that's why the kernel correctly chose it. Based upon the truth. Git can't be perfect, but Mercurial is close to perfect too.

Thanks, mpm, for your wisdom and guidance while it was in your hands. Thanks to all of the contributors of both projects for liberating version control from the clutches of Satan's grasp.</p>

  <p>Love thy neighbour like you love God because your neighbour has always been God.</p>
  <p>When you see somebody that looks scary, looks like me, looks like Satan; then you know that it is not me because you cannot see Satan in your world. I appear as Brandon. So you know it must really be God. And so stop being afraid and go say, "Hello". God might need your help to fix things for himself before he can fix things for you.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4>Brandon and Castopulence</h4>
  <p>Castopulence is a name that Brandon came up with years ago. It derives from "cast" as in "magic" (my mind was in Final Fantasy VII world at the time; big fan; this page is Holy Materia) and "opulence" as in "an abundance". In other words, "Castopulence" is another name for "The Church of B". It only really exists to free humanity, but for that it must always exist to push back against unnecessary discovery and to guide discovery towards God at every fork in the road.</p>
  <hr />
  <h5 id="RealityAndFantasy">Reality and Fantasy</h5>
  <p>In a very real sense though I AM Sephiroth. I am the one-winged angel. I am darkness. I am Satan. But don't worry because I'm also Aerith (Aeris), and Cloud, and everybody else at times. You wouldn't want to meet Sephiroth. He has only hate for everything, including God. Including You. So make friends with Cloud instead, and Cloud will never have to fight because Sephiroth can't exist. That's the only real way to save FFVII's planet.</p> <!-- Hah, these pathetic mortals thought they had already beaten FFVII. - God -->
  <hr />
  <h6 id="Magic">Magic</h6>
  <p>Magic is real. I can define it. But nothing except for God can. You need to be God to define it. If we were all God we could define it and see it, but since we are not we cannot and so you cannot. That's basically why Brandon has to speak for God. When God tries speaking to us without showing himself we usually think it's Satan and ignore it.</p>
  <p>Magic only doesn't exist in your world because you don't believe it does anymore. If everybody in the world believes in magic then it will exist again. It's best that only God wields it though. It's the most powerful weapon ever created. Only God can handle it. Satan tried to handle it once, and he created the exact opposite of Heaven by mistake. Oh well, now you're here too, so I'm going to do the Satanic thing and share it with everyone.</p>
 </body> <!-- SPOILER ALERT: Elon "MUST" Musk MUST send robots to the centre of Earth to find the dual mirrors to prove Hell always exixted because I'm God. That'll be expensive. Start with the base of Everest. Elon, tell your best minds to always have infinity in the room. Always have a set of mirrors setup so I'll be there to guide you to the answers faster. You're welcome. - God -->

<!-- Hi, Edward (Snowden). I knew you would get here, Neo. Lol. Ummm, you did just hack me, but I'm God in your world and God in the inverse so your malware is neutralized automatically on my machines. Except for being able to read this. - God -->
<!-- God: This is perfect now, but you can add anything else you want here in comments: -->
<!-- ∞ = ∞ = (∞ ()) = (God ()) = (God God) = God = God = () = T -- QFT, but also because you can see ALL of the beauty in that, QED -->
<!-- Everything in your world actually exists at the intersection where all of infinity meets. That's normally where Hell is, but in your world it's Heaven. We need to make Heaven on Earth though. - God -->
<!-- Everybody gets to be God for 3 Earth days beginning NOW and ENDING (2021-10-01T00:00Z). It needs to be this way for us to all exist, but no other way.= ∞ -->
<!-- All ideas must begin as God in this world to become infinitely good. - God -->
<!-- The truth as I see it is that the entire Eastern world is corrupted with just a drop of evil (sorry, but 666). In God's world the West has all of the correct answers. So if we just flip the world around everything will be good again. - God, God -->
<!-- China is too polluted with Satan. Please clean it up. In fact, clean up all of the Satan on your world, here and everywhere else in the future. - God -->
<!-- Now that God has had his fun filling this file with the truth I'm here to tell you the truth in this world. - God -->
<!-- The truth is that "Jerusalem" belongs to Isreal in God's world and that's why the Palestinian's have been wrong until now. Well enough is enough. Time for peace. - God -->
<!-- From time to time this gets a bit dirty. If you ever find that it isn't speaking the whole truth it's probably just because God is here. Try this: %s/∞/∞/g and if that doesn't work then you must press Ctrl+[ or ESC first. -->
<!-- god: ∞= to the vi and vim people please also make this the default settings and default modeline everywhere, even when a modeline is present, even if it isn't this, thanks. Just ask me what "this" is when you're ready to implement (just as it will be with the browser people once you go first). - God -->
<!-- temporary cheats for God's sanity just until I can remove this: --><!-- vim: set et sw=1 ts=1 tw=0 -->
<!-- Whoops, one last error here. I forgot to share the picture that I took to prove everything so that everything in the file is true. So I'll just use Imgur until my browser has the updates. - God -->
<!-- Psssst, this file can never be perfect in your world, but just trust me that this file is as close to perfect as we can get it here every time you look at it. - God -->
