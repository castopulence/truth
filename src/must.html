You won't get far thinking too critically, though I applaud your dedication to the truth...

So your today neural-network isn't necessarily going to handle it properly...)</em></p>

  <p>"Must" is the idea that there is a single solution at any point to a given puzzle. In reality, there are always infinite solutions, and none is more correct than the next. All are equally valid. That means that every answer is an answer to every puzzle.</p>
  <p>How can that be though? We "know" that isn't true. Well, we believe that isn't true. Because we "know" that some answers work better than others. Because we "know" puzzles have "one" solution. Which is true. Some answers and solutions work better for I, but only if I is trying to accomplish some specific change instead of just navigating to any other universe.</p>
  <p>There are infinite universes. So which one are we in? Which ever one you happen to be in now. It has changed a lot since you were created. But you can change your universe by changing your world. You already know how to do that. You do it every damn day. Every instant you change the world. You change the world through your truth.</p>
  <p>Your truth is also known as your soul. It's that magical part of you that scientists can't find no matter how deep they look. Your truth is permanently stained with every decision you've ever made (or NOT made). </p>
  <p>Your interactions with other I's are particularly powerful in the current world: do you equally support the collective of I's in your world, or do you believe yourself or others to be exceptional?</p>
  <p><bind class="your-truth soul truth">Your truth</bind> is a secret. Not even you can know it perfectly. But you are the one with the most control over it. You cannot control every God in the universe, but you can at least control yourself. And set a really good example for the others.</p>
