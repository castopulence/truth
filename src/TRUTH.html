  <p>We're all doing our best to do better, but the truth keeps getting in the way.</pperfect>
  <p>I'm <bind class="person-sufficiently-different-to-struggle-in-society" title="person-sufficiently-different-to-struggle-in-society">Autistic</bind>. For me, and not necessarily for everyone <bind class="assigned-diagnosis" title="assigned-diagnosis">diagnosed</bind> (or <bind inverted="true" id="assigned-diagnosis" title="notassigned-diagnosis">undiagnosed</bind>) with <bind class="autism-spectrum-disorder" title="autism-spectrum-disorder">Autism Spectrum Disorder</bind>, that means that I <bind class="really-like love crave desire chase hunt defend sacrifice-for" title="really-like love crave desire chase hunt defend sacrifice-for">really like</bind> the <bind class="truth" title="truth">absolute truth</bind>.</p>
  <p>I don't care who the truth hurts, even if it hurts me, because I believe that the truth is the best thing that there is for the collective (society).</p>
  <p>And that's because you taught me that it was. You taught me that because <bind class="it-is truth exists" title="it-is truth exists">it is</bind> <bind class="true" title="true">true</bind>.</p>
  <p>Facebook is getting into trouble because <bind class="it-is truth exists" title="it-is truth exists">it is</bind> <bind class="evil" title="evil">full of lies</bind>. But <bind class="it-is truth exists" title="it-is truth exists">it is</bind> only <bind class="evil" title="evil">full of lies</bind> because that's all that <bind class="the-collective" title="the-collective">we</bind> will <bind class="tolerate" title="tolerate">tolerate</bind>.</p>
  <p><bind class="socialmedia-2.0" title="socialmedia-2.0">Social Media 2.0</bind> needs to do something different. It needs to be transparent about the fact that it is rewriting every post for the user reading it.</p>
  <p>It needs to use <bind class="artificial-intelligence" title="artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</bind> to understand your beliefs through <bind class="web-analytics" title="web-analytics">Web analytics</bind> (or your own <bind class="conscious-choice" title="conscious-choice">manual selections</bind>), and tell you a <bind class="story" title="story">story</bind> in <bind class="parallel" title="parallel">parallel</bind> to <bind class="each-individual-in-existence-ever" title="each-individual-in-existence-ever">every</bind> <bind class="post" title="post">post</bind> on the <bind class="platform" title="platform">platform</bind> that <bind class="you collective the-reader which-really-just-means-everyone including-me" title="you collective the-reader which-really-just-means-everyone including-me">YOU</bind> can <bind class="understand" title="understand">UNDERSTAND</bind>.
  <p>A story that <strong><bind class="will-not-hurt-you" title="will-not-hurt-you"><bind class="will-not" title="will-not">won't <bind class="hurt-you" title="hurt-you">hurt you</bind></bind></strong>.</p>
  <p>The platform needs to be transparent that the post that you're reading was authored by <bind class="artificial-intelligence" title="artificial-intelligence">AI</bind>, and not the actual author of the post, and it needs to be transparent about the lies that it introduces into the narrative to help you understand.</p>
  <p>We need you not only to LIKE posts, but we need you to UNDERSTAND posts. If you don't understand the post then <bind class="it-is truth exists" title="it-is truth exists">it is</bind> either a lie or you're biased. Either way, you get ZERO value from it.</p>
  <p>And so the collective gets zero value from you reading it. The risk then is that the only thing that it can ever do is bring negative value to society (zero being neutral).</p>
  <p>If <bind class="socialmedia-1.0" title="socialmedia-1.0">Facebook</bind> is worth that much telling you only lies, IMAGINE how valuable <bind class="facebook-inc" title="facebook-inc">Facebook</bind> is going to be when it only tells you the truth, and it makes sure you understand the truth.</p>
  <p>To fix the world we need for <bind class="socialmedia" title="socialmedia">Facebook</bind> to tell the truth, and we need for you to be able to understand the truth without a knee-jerk caveman reaction of hitting back because it hurts..</p>
  <p>We need to bypass that painful part of the message for you so that you can still access the contents of the post equitably. And so the social media platform of your choosing should be able to expose you to messages that you find uncomfortable by design, but do so in a way that cussions you from the discomfort to help you come around to understanding the truth of the content. Then once you have an understanding of the truth we can peel back the lies that helped you to understand so that you can face the real truth (but <strong>only if you are ready</strong> to do so).</p>
  <p>Here's the best part: school is a place where we send everybody to be taught the truth. They need the truth to survive and to coexist in society peacefully.</p>
  <p>What we're discovering is that <bind class="socialmedia-2.0" title="socialmedia-2.0">Social Media 2.0</bind> is actually also <bind class="socialmedia-2.0" title="socialmedia-2.0">School 2.0</bind>.</p>
  <p>It's the fastest and most fun way to learn about the world. That's why we're all so addicted to doing it.</p>
  <p>The only problem with <bind class="socialmedia-1.0" title="socialmedia-1.0">Social Media 1.0</bind> today is that it isn't teaching us the truth.</p>
  <p>It's not teaching us complete fiction either, but you have to work hard to spot the truth through all of the lies.</p>
  <p>Web analytics can help us to understand which truths you're comfortable with and which ones you have trouble with today.</p>
  <p>It seems to me that we're going to eventually need words to tell entire stories. They already do, of course, but we need to acknowledge it.</p>
  <p>And so binary computers may not "understand" what <bind class="pain" title="pain">pain</bind> is, but at least we can teach them pain is a <bind class="truth" title="truth">truth</bind>, and it only has one meaning that spans an infinite spectrum, even if some of us can't understand it anymore.</p>
  <p><bind class="artificial-intelligence" title="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</bind> can understand the world by relating all of the words and stories together in all of their infinite ways.</p>

But we all know <bind class="it-is truth exists" title="it-is truth exists">it is</bind> mako/lifestream anyway.</p>
  <p>Of course the artificial intelligence that I describe will become the <bind class="universal-translator-jenova universal-translator jenova" title="universal-translator jenova">universal translator</bind> (which I'd just name jenova to be consistent with the FFVII theme, but "<bind class="universal-translator-jenova universal-translator jenova">universal translator</bind>" also worked fine in <bind class="star-trek-tng">Star Trek</bind>) from <bind class="star-trek-the-next-generation star-trek-tng st-tng tng really-progressive-compared-to-today 1980s-and-1990s" title="star-trek-the-next-generation star-trek-tng st-tng tng really-progressive-compared-to-today 1980s-and-1990s">Star Trek: The Next Generation</bind>'s <bind class="fiction fantasy imagination dreams predictions-for-the-future" title="fiction fantasy imagination dreams predictions-for-the-future">fiction</bind>.</p>
  <p>Instead of just free-for-all comments we could build a technology that automates some of the necessary feedback loop needed to get the truth matching everybody's understanding in the world.</p>
  <p>For example, if you're reading ANYTHING and aren't sure what the author meant you should be able to just point to the words you're interested in and be able to ping the author to ask them if they also mean some list of "other-class-name" too, and when the author responds the content should be updated to reflect it at the main source for the work automatically, and then ideally spread from there to the rest of the copies in the world.
  <p>That means we'll need to standardize the infinite tools for tracking this so that publishers/journalists/writers/everyone can easily setup a tracked document.</p>
  <p>I hate to imagine there being engineers in secretive rooms in billion-dollar facilities trying to figure out how to train artificial intelligence to just INFER all of this between the lines stuff that we aren't saying. Why not just work in reverse? It's a lot easier.</p>

  <p>This is a video that I threw together while trying to get high so that I could relax about all of this...</p>
  <p>I got super high and had a lot of fun and arguably made a great video with wonderful points, but I haven't gotten to relax yet...</p>
  <p>I think that I won't be able to relax until enough of you get it.</p>
  <p>The video is age restricted because of my consumption of legal cannabis (Canada has legalized recreational use for 3 years now!) and my use of the truth (adult language).</p>
  <p>Also some cursing was probably responsible.</p>
  <p>Don't let that deter you from watching it.</p>
  <p>Eventually I'd like to get YouTube to reconsider.</p>
  <p>Though I also haven't ruled out just rerecording a video that I try really hard to keep squeaky "clean".</p>
