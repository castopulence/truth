  <p>Not a supremacist. Just thinking out loud. White men (or men across races and cultures) don't really have a voice in the West anymore. Which is a big problem because there's nobody telling women no anymore. So they think they're actually helping while they tear everything our forefathers built down. And why wouldn't they? We taught them that when they do something wrong we are responsible for it, not them. And we are sitting back watching everything fall apart powerless, and from their perspective we're giving their performance 6/5 stars. Why would they deflect from their usual narcisistic thoughts of centering existence on themselves to reflect on whether their actions are actually helping? We're the canary that tells them when they've fucked up. But we can't do that anymore.</p>
  <p>But what if we organized ourselves into a political movement that fought for children and men instead of women's privileges? We could actually crush Feminism, and take over the equality movement for the good of everyone. They may have started something good, but it's clear that they don't know what to do with it anymore. Thoughts?</p>
  <p>There will be many differing political positions among us. We'll need to find common ground to share, and structure the overall movement so that it can attack and self-heal corruption from within. It won't be difficult to find commonalities. All of our families are coming apart or at least at risk of it.</p>
  <p>We should expect fragmentation from the extremists. Our goal will be to build an organization centred on the truth instead of on just pleasing its investors. We'll defeat Feminism organically by just being a better equality movement. Honestly, this may be what is necessary. For men to pick up the torch and do what women cannot seem to. Stick to being fair across the board. We'll operate professionally, and we'll make sure that the science is actually in agreement with our understanding. And we'll fix our understanding instead of fixing the science. If we keep waiting for women to fix this they never will. It's too advantageous for them to keep acting like children with government protection. But it's not good for the children, or the women, or the men. It's just a losing game played by sore losers who are just trying to make the rest of us as useless as they are so they can feel good about it instead of bad. Because women are full of negative emotion. That's their natural state of being. Don't fall for it. Snap them out of it and demand accountability instead.</p>
  <p>If men organize we can easily defeat anything by actually being better. We can raise more money to spend more time actually researching the truth. We can defeat Feminism at its own games. Just think about it. Whatever men set out to dominate they will. It's time that men invested their money wisely into political discourse instead of divorse lawyer fees after the unhappy women convince your wife that she deserves better and that better exists, only for her to royally fuck up herself, yourself and family.</p>
